## Installation
    
1. Access main branch at my github repo and clone to your local folder to install app: https://github.com/204039643/react-employee-directory
2. Navigate to app. folder on local and run 'NPM INSTALL' in the CLI.
3. I used gh-pages to publish to cloud hosting site. To do so, update package.json "homepage:" key value to point to your new published app URL using the format> http://yourgithubid.github.io/yourappname".
4. Switch to 'master' branch for github pages.
5. Link and push newly cloned project to GitHub by running the following commands in the CLI:
- git add .
- git commit -m "first commit"
- git remote add origin git@github.com:username/guide-react-gh-pages.git

6. Run "NPM RUN DEPLOY" script in CLI which will do a prod. build and then deploy to your gh-pages repo.
7. Navigate to the newly deployed app in your browser to validate deployment and functionality.
